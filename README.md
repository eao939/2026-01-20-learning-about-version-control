Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

Favourite thing: Creates backup copies of past work without manually saving a million copies. No more "finalcopy", "finalcopy1", "FINALcopy", "FINALFINALcopy", "THISONEISFINAL"

Least Favourite thing: Getting stuck in conflict loop... I once accidentally wiped my team's entire git history because I was trying to solve a merge error on my end and got my commmits tangled up but didn't want to lose all my local progress. That caused everyone else's branch to throw errors because they diverged from main and had no upstream commits
